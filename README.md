# Hand Gesture Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Objective
The objective of this mini-project is to develop CNN models capable of accurately classifying sign language letters based on image inputs. By training neural networks on a dataset of sign language gestures, the models will aim to recognize and classify hand gestures into their corresponding letters.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of grayscale images of hand gestures representing sign language letters. Each image is of size 28x28 pixels, and the dataset includes labeled examples for training and testing.

### Features
- Input Image: Grayscale images of hand gestures representing sign language letters.
- Target Variable: The target variable is the class label corresponding to the sign language letter depicted in the input image.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of the following components:
1. First Convolutional Layer: Applies a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input data to extract features.
2. Second Convolutional Layer: Applies another set of learnable filters to capture more abstract and higher-level features.
3. Activation Function: ReLU activation function is applied after each convolutional layer.
4. Max Pooling Layer: Down-samples the feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions.
5. Dropout Layer: Helps prevent overfitting by introducing randomness into the network.
6. Output Layer: Consists of 26 nodes for each class (A-Z).


## Model Training
- Compilation: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer.
- Training: The model is trained for 10 epochs.
- Evaluation: Changes in loss and testing accuracy for each epoch are monitored.

## Results
Analyzing variations in loss and testing accuracy over epochs helps assess model performance.

### Observations on Overfitting
1) Loss and Accuracy Trends: Initially, both training and validation losses decrease while accuracy improves. However, after a certain point, the validation loss starts to rise while training loss continues to decrease, indicating potential overfitting.

2)Overfitting Identification: The model exhibits overfitting, characterized by increasing validation loss and decreasing training loss, coupled with high training accuracy but lower performance on unseen data.

3)Dropout for Regularization: Dropout, a regularization technique, can alleviate overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training. Adding a dropout layer after convolutional layers, typically with a dropout rate of 0.3, could enhance regularization.

4)Shared Weight Structure: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) employ shared weights in convolutional layers, enabling efficient learning of spatial features across the input image.

5)Invariance with Pooling: CNNs inherently possess invariance due to pooling layers, which downsample feature maps while preserving essential information, along with convolutional layers capturing invariance to transformations.

6)Utilizing Shared Structure: By sharing convolutional filters across the input image, the model efficiently learns spatial hierarchies of features, enhancing its ability to identify patterns regardless of their position.

7)Enhancing Invariance: Pooling layers and convolutional operations contribute to capturing invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations in input images, improving the model's robustness.

8)Optimization and Experimentation: Incorporating additional dropout layers after convolutional layers requires experimentation to find the optimal dropout rate and architectural modifications, considering the dataset's complexity and model characteristics.


### Handling Overfitting
Adding another dropout layer (e.g., with rate 0.3) after the convolutional layers may further reduce overfitting by introducing more randomness into the network.

### Share Structure and Invariance Property
The CNN architecture inherently leverages the share structure and invariance property in image classification tasks. By stacking convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers, the network learns to extract increasingly abstract and hierarchical features from the input data while being invariant to translations and distortions.
